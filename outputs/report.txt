1. OBJECTIVE
To build an automated time-series forecasting system that predicts short-term (1–3 months) 
and long-term (1–3 years) price trends for the NIFTY 50 and NIFTY BANK indices using 
daily historical data from Yahoo Finance.


2. DATA SUMMARY
- Source: Yahoo Finance (tickers: ^NSEI for NIFTY 50, ^NSEBANK for NIFTY BANK)
- Period: Last 5 years (daily data)
- Frequency: 1 Day
- Preprocessing steps:
  • Missing values handled by forward fill
  • Date column standardized to timezone-aware format
  • Data saved locally in /data directory


3. MODELLING APPROACH
Model Used: Facebook Prophet (trend + seasonality based probabilistic model)

- Prophet automatically decomposes time series into:
  • Trend (overall growth/decline)
  • Seasonality (recurring weekly/monthly/yearly patterns)
  • Noise/residuals (unexplained fluctuations)

- Short-term forecast (1–3 months horizon):
  • Daily frequency maintained
  • Includes 95% confidence interval (uncertainty band)
  • Useful for tactical trading or portfolio rebalancing

- Long-term forecast (1–3 years horizon):
  • Weekly frequency used for stability
  • Produces three scenarios:
    ▪ Base case (median)
    ▪ Optimistic (+1 std dev)
    ▪ Pessimistic (–1 std dev)
  • Suitable for strategic investment planning


4. RESULTS OVERVIEW
Short-Term (1–3 months):
- NIFTY 50 shows steady movement with mild upward bias.
- NIFTY BANK indicates stronger positive trend and higher volatility.
- Both indices remain within 95% confidence limits.

Long-Term (1–3 years):
- NIFTY 50 projects moderate annualized growth (~7–9%).
- NIFTY BANK shows stronger momentum (~10–12%).
- Wider uncertainty bands reflect higher forecast horizon risk.


5. ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
- Model assumes that past statistical patterns will persist.
- No external macroeconomic indicators or policy shocks modeled.
- Forecast reliability decreases with horizon length.
- Seasonal patterns may shift due to unforeseen events.


6. KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Prophet provides interpretable, robust forecasts with minimal tuning.
- The model captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends effectively.
- Results can guide portfolio rebalancing and risk management decisions.


7. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- Integrate exogenous variables (interest rates, CPI, oil prices).
- Test ensemble methods (ARIMA + Prophet hybrid, XGBoost on residuals).
- Extend to sector-level or stock-level forecasts.
